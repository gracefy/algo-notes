## About this repo

This repo is a structured log of problems I've worked through, mainly from LeetCode.  
The focus is on clarity, consistency, and building long-term problem-solving skills—not speed or quantity.

Each problem includes:

- Brief problem statement (or link)
- My solution code
- Time and space complexity
- Notes on approach, patterns, or things I learned

Some topics are tagged with recurring techniques to help spot patterns over time.

## Topics (so far)

This is a work in progress. I’ll continue adding new problems and improving notes as I go.
